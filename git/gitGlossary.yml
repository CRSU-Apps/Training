Merge: |
  When changes from one source (repo or branch) are integrated into another.
  
Remote: |
  Anything which is not found on the computer being used at the time, but is stored elsewhere, is considered "remote". This can be applied to: files, changes, repositories, branches, etc. A common example is a repository hosted on GitHub.com.
  
Repository: |
  A folder on your own computer, or in the cloud, which contains the files and tracks the changes. Sometimes refered to as a 'repo' (REE-po).
  
Revert: |
  When uncommitted changes are discarded, to restore the file(s) back to the most recent commit, they are 'reverted'.
  
Pull: |
