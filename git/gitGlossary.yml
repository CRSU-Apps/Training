Branch: |
  Branches are copies of the entire codebase which exist in parallel in a respository.
  
Checkout: |
  When a branch is loaded onto the local computer, it is 'checked out.
  
Clone: |
  Downloading a copy of an existing repository is called 'cloning'.
  
Codebase: |
  The complete set of files containing the code from which an application or website is built.
  
Commit: |
  A 'commit' is a record of when changes to files are added, or 'committed', to the repository. Before the changes are committed, they are not saved in the version history.
  
Conflict: |
  When changes are made to the same lines in a version-controlled file from multiple sources. Changes must be manually merged to reolve the conflicts.
  
Diff: |
  Short for 'difference'. A record of the changes made to a file between commits.
  
Fetch: |
  In Git, remote changes can be 'fetched', so that they can be inspected before they are merged into the working copy.
  
Git: |
  Git is an application which manages files in version control, keeping track of all changes made to them.
  
GitHub: |
  Github.com is a file hosting service which uses Git to manage version control.
  
History: |
  A record of all versions of the files, and the changes made between them.
  
Local: |
  The changes made and committed on a computer are only found on that 'local' computer, until they are pushed to the 'remote' repository
  
Merge: |
  When changes from one source (repo or branch) are integrated into another.
  
Remote: |
  A 'remote' repository is one which is not found on the local computer, but is stored elsewhere. A common example is a repository hosted on GitHub.com.
  
Repository: |
  A folder on your own computer, or in the cloud, which contains the files and tracks the changes. Sometimes refered to as a 'repo' (REE-po).
  
Revert: |
  When uncommitted changes are discarded, to restore the file(s) back to the most recent commit, they are 'reverted'.
  
Pull: |
  Changes in a remote repository are 'pulled' into the local repository. These remote changes are then found in the local history.
  
Pull Request: |
  A pull request (or "PR") is a request to merge code from one branch into another.
  
Push: |
  Local changes are uploaded, or 'pushed', to a remote repository.
  
Source code: |
  The code from which an application or website is built.
  
Stage: |
  'Staging' local changes marks them as ready for committing. Whole files, or individual changes within a file can be staged.
